      "title": "Can We Hold Back the Flood?",
      "body": "LAST winter's floods on the rivers of central Europe were among the worst since the Middle Ages, and as winter storms return, the spectre of floods is returning too. Just weeks ago, the river Rhone in south-east France burst its banks, driving 15,000 people from their homes, and worse could be on the way. Traditionally, river engineers have gone for Plan A: get rid of the water fast, draining it off the land and down to the sea in tall-sided rivers re-engineered as high-performance drains. But however big they dig city drains, however wide and straight they make the rivers, and however high they build the banks, the floods keep coming back to taunt them, from the Mississippi to the Danube. And when the floods come, they seem to be worse than ever. No wonder engineers are turning to Plan B: sap the water's destructive strength by dispersing it into fields, forgotten lakes, flood plains, and aquifers. Back in the days when rivers took a more tortuous path to the sea, flood waters lost impetus and volume while meandering across flood plains and aquifers. The same is taking place on a much grander scale in Austria, in one of Europe's largest river restorations to date. Engineers are regenerating flood plains along 60 kilometers of the river Drava as it exits the Alps. They are also widening the river bed and channeling it back into abandoned meanders, oxbow lakes, and backwaters overhung with willows. The engineers calculate that the restored flood plain can now store up to 10 million cubic meters of flood waters and slow storm surges coming out of the Alps by more than an hour, protecting towns as far downstream as Slovenia and Croatia. 'Rivers have to be allowed to take more space. They have to be turned from flood-chutes into flood-spellers,' says Neithuns. And the Dutch, for whom preventing floods is a matter of survival, have gone furthest. A nation built largely on drained marshes and seabed had the fright of its life in 1993 when the Rhine almost overwhelmed it. The same happened again in 1995, when a quarter of a million people were evacuated from the Netherlands. But a new breed of 'soft engineers' wants our cities to become porous, and Berlin is now governed by tough new rules to prevent its drains becoming overloaded after heavy rains. Harald Kraft, an architect working in the city, says: 'We now see rainwater as a resource at giant Potsdamer Platz, a huge commercial development by DaimlerChrysler at the heart of the city.' Los Angeles has spent billions of dollars digging huge drains and concreting river beds to carry away the water from occasional intense storms. 'In LA we receive half the water we need in rainfall, and we throw it away. Then we spend hundreds of millions to import water,' says Andy Lipkis, an LA environmentalist who kick-started the idea of the porous city by showing it could work on one house. Lipkis, along with citizens' groups like Friends of the Los Angeles River and Unpaved LA, wants to beat the urban flood hazard and fill the taps by holding onto the city's flood water. And it is not just a pipe dream. The authorities in the San Fernando Valley are turning thousands of driveways, parking lots, and rooftops in the valley into water catchments. Trees will soak up water from parking lots. Homes and public buildings will capture roof water to irrigate gardens and parks. And road drains will empty into old gravel pits and other leaky places that should recharge the city's underground water resources. Result: less flooding and more water for the city. Plan B says every city should be porous, every river should have room to flood naturally, and every coastline should be left to build its own defenses. It sounds expensive and utopian, until you realize how much we spend trying to drain cities and protect our watery margins—and how bad we are at it.",

      "title": "When the Tulip Bubble Burst",
      "body": "Tulips are spring-blooming perennials that grow from bulbs. Depending on the species, tulip plants can grow as short as 4 inches (10 cm) or as high as 28 inches (71 cm). The tulip's large flowers usually bloom on scapes or sub-scapose stems that lack bracts. Most tulips produce only one flower per stem, but a few species bear multiple flowers on their scapes (e.g., Tulipa turkestanica). The showy, generally cup or star-shaped tulip flowers have three petals and three sepals, which are often termed tepals because they are nearly identical. These six tepals are often marked on the interior surface near the bases with darker colorings. Tulip flowers come in a wide variety of colors, except pure blue (several tulips with 'blue' in the name have a faint violet hue). Long before anyone ever heard of Qualcomm, CMGI, Cisco Systems, or the other high-tech stocks that have soared during the current bull market, there was Semper Augustus. Both more prosaic and more sublime than any stock or bond, it was a tulip of extraordinary beauty, its midnight-blue petals topped by a band of pure white and accented with crimson flares. To denizens of 17th century Holland, little was as desirable. Around 1624, the Amsterdam man who owned the only dozen specimens was offered 3,000 guilders for one bulb. While there's no accurate way to render that in today's dollars, the sum was roughly equal to the annual income of a wealthy merchant. (A few years later, Rembrandt received about half that amount for painting The Night Watch.) Yet the bulb's owner, whose name is now lost to history, rejected the offer. Who was crazier, the tulip lover who refused to sell for a small fortune or the one who was willing to splurge? That's a question that springs to mind after reading Tulipmania: The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower and the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused by British journalist Mike Dash. In recent years, as investors have intentionally forgotten everything they learned in Investing 101 in order to load up on unproven, unprofitable dot-com issues, tulipmania has been invoked frequently. In this concise, artfully written account, Dash tells the real history behind the buzzword and, in doing so, offers a cautionary tale for our times. The Dutch were not the first to go gaga over the tulip. Long before the first tulip bloomed in Europe—in Bavaria, it turns out, in 1559—the flower had enchanted the Persians and bewitched the rulers of the Ottoman Empire. It was in Holland, however, that the passion for tulips found its most fertile ground, for reasons that had little to do with horticulture. Holland in the early 17th century was embarking on its Golden Age. Resources that had just a few years earlier gone toward fighting for independence from Spain now flowed into commerce. Amsterdam merchants were at the center of the lucrative East Indies trade, where a single voyage could yield profits of 400%. They displayed their success by erecting grand estates surrounded by flower gardens. The Dutch population seemed torn by two contradictory impulses: a horror of living beyond one’s means and the love of a long shot. Enter the tulip. 'It is impossible to comprehend the tulip mania without understanding just how different tulips were from every other flower known to horticulturists in the 17th century,' says Dash. 'The colors they exhibited were more intense and more concentrated than those of ordinary plants.' Despite the outlandish prices commanded by rare bulbs, ordinary tulips were sold by the pound. Around 1630, however, a new type of tulip fancier appeared, lured by tales of fat profits. These 'florists,' or professional tulip traders, sought out flower lovers and speculators alike. But if the supply of tulip buyers grew quickly, the supply of bulbs did not. The tulip was a conspirator in the supply squeeze: it takes seven years to grow one from seed. And while bulbs can produce two or three clones, or 'offsets,' annually, the mother bulb only lasts a few years. Bulb prices rose steadily throughout the 1630s, as ever more speculators entered the market. Weavers and farmers mortgaged whatever they could to raise cash to begin trading. In 1633, a farmhouse in Hoorn changed hands for three rare bulbs. By 1636, any tulip—even bulbs recently considered garbage—could be sold off, often for hundreds of guilders. A futures market for bulbs existed, and tulip traders could be found conducting their business in hundreds of Dutch taverns. Tulipmania reached its peak during the winter of 1636-37, when some bulbs were changing hands ten times in a day. The zenith came early that winter, at an auction to benefit seven orphans whose only asset was 70 fine tulips left by their father. One, a rare Violetten Admirael van Enkhuizen, sold for 5,200 guilders, the all-time record. All told, the flowers brought in nearly 53,000 guilders. Soon after, the tulip market crashed utterly, spectacularly. It began in Haarlem, at a routine bulb auction when, for the first time, the greater fool refused to show up and pay. Within days, the panic had spread across the country. Despite the efforts of traders to prop up demand, the market for tulips evaporated. Flowers that had commanded 5,000 guilders a few weeks before now fetched one-hundredth that amount. Tulipmania is not without flaws. Dash dwells too long on the tulip’s migration across Europe, but the financial folly remains compelling. Tulipmania differed in one crucial aspect from the dot-com craze that grips our attention today. Even at its height, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, well-established in 1630, wouldn’t touch tulips. 'The speculation in tulip bulbs always existed at the margins of Dutch economic life,' Dash writes. After the market crashed, a compromise was brokered that let most traders settle their debts for a fraction of their liability. The overall fallout on the Dutch economy was negligible. Will we say the same when Wall Street’s current obsession finally runs its course?",

      "title": "The Secrets of Persuasion",
      "body": "Our mother may have told you the secret to getting what you ask for was to say please. The reality is rather more surprising. Adam Dudding talks to a psychologist who has made a life’s work from the science of persuasion. Some scientists peer at things through high-powered microscopes. Others goad rats through mazes, or mix bubbling fluids in glass beakers. Robert Cialdini, for his part, does curious things with towels, and believes that by doing so he is discovering important insights into how society works. Cialdini’s towel experiments (more of them later) are part of his research into how we persuade others to say yes. He wants to know why some people have a knack for bending the will of others, be it a telephone cold-caller talking to you about timeshares, or a parent whose children are compliant even without threats of extreme violence. While he’s anxious not to be seen as the man who’s written the bible for snake-oil salesmen, for decades the Arizona State University social psychology professor has been creating systems for the principles and methods of persuasion, and writing bestsellers about them. Some people seem to be born with the skills. Cialdini’s claim is that by applying a little science, even those of us who aren’t should be able to get our own way more often. 'All my life I’ve been an easy mark for the blandishments of salespeople and fundraisers, and I’d always wondered why they could get me to buy things I didn’t want and give to causes I hadn’t heard of,' says Cialdini on the phone from London, where he is plugging his latest book. He found that laboratory experiments on the psychology of persuasion were telling only part of the story, so he began to research influence in the real world, enrolling in sales-training programs: 'I learned how to sell automobiles from a lot, how to sell insurance from an office, how to sell encyclopedias door to door.' He concluded there were six general 'principles of influence' and has since put them to the test, under slightly more scientific conditions. Most recently, that has meant messing about with towels. Many hotels leave a little card in each bathroom asking guests to reuse towels and thus conserve water and electricity and reduce pollution. Cialdini and his colleagues wanted to test the relative effectiveness of different words on those cards. Would guests be more co-operative simply because it would help save the planet, or was another factor more compelling? To test this, the researchers changed the card’s message from an environmental one to the simple (and truthful) statement that the majority of guests at the hotel had reused their towel at least once. Guests given this message were 26% more likely to reuse their towels than those given the old message. In Cialdini’s book 'Yes! 50 Secrets from the Science of Persuasion,' co-written with another social scientist and a business consultant, he explains that guests were responding to the principle of social proof, where our decisions are strongly influenced by what we believe other people like us are doing. So much for towels. Cialdini has also learned a lot from confectionery. Yes! cites the work of New Jersey behavioral scientist David Strohmetz, who wanted to see how restaurant patrons would respond to a ridiculously small favor from their food server, in the form of an after-dinner chocolate for each diner. The secret, it seems, is in how you give the chocolate. When the chocolates arrived in a heap with the bill, tips went up a miserly 3% compared to when no chocolate was given. But when the chocolates were dropped individually in front of each diner, tips went up 14%. The scientific breakthrough, though, came when the waitress gave each diner one chocolate, headed away from the table, then doubled back to give them one more each, as if such generosity had only just occurred to her. Tips went up 23%. This illustrates the principle of reciprocity, where people feel obliged to give back when they receive something first.",
